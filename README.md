# Real-Time Flight Tracking Pipeline
This project implements a real-time flight tracking data pipeline that simulates, processes, and stores flight information using modern data engineering tools and technologies. The pipeline generates synthetic flight data, streams it through Apache Kafka, processes it with Apache Spark Streaming, and persists the latest flight records in PostgreSQL.
## This is the architecture of the project
